Sorry to write in English, but my Spanish is - well - non-existant :)<br />

I saw you mention that Spurl.net is not in Spanish - which is true - but with our launch of version 1.0 last week, the interface can actually be translated quite easily. So if someone is ready to spend approximately 4 hours to translate and following that a few hours more to finalize the translation, we&#39;re all ears. The link to the app is [LINK=http://www.spurl.net/]Spurl.net[~LINK] and you can also read the [LINK=http://www.spurl.net/help/forum/viewtopic.php?id=323]announcement of version 1.0[~LINK]."
