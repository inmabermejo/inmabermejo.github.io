This morning, one of our user databases suffered a failure that wasn&prime;t detected by our monitoring systems. This resulted in the inability of people to log into their Bloglines accounts. The database has been reset and no data was lost. We apologize for the issue and we&prime;re looking at ways to ensure this doesn&prime;t happen again. "
