A través del <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/alexsancho/status/33567871380488192" target="_blank">twitter de Álex Sancho</a> llego a esta iniciativa, <a href="﻿http://www.dontmakemesteal.com/" target="_blank">Don’t Make Me Steal</a>,  que, aunque no me gusta mucho su nombre, ya que copiar no es robar, creo que tienen un manifiesto bastante interesante:

## 1. Pricing

In general I want the pricing model to be simple and transparent. I don’t mind a slight difference in pricing between movies with regard to the age of the movie.

En general, quiero que

  * Rentals should not exceed 1/3 of the cinema price.
  * Purchases should not exceed the cinema price.
  * Monthly flat rate prices should not exceed 3 visits to the cinema.
  * Pricing of TV shows is about 1/3 of movies.
  * Payments are for the content, not bandwidth.

## 2. Languages

  * I can obtain the audio in every language produced for the content.
  * After purchasing a movie, all the languages are available.
  * Fans are legally allowed to create and share subtitles for any content.

## 3. Convenience

  * The content I paid for is instantly available.
  * Content is delivered without ads, or disrupting infringement warnings.
  * I can find movies or TV shows by year, director, language, country, genre, IMDB ID, etc.

## 4. Choice And Release Dates

  * The release date is global. There are no limits regarding the country you live in.
  * I can download nearly every movie ever made.

## 5. Rights

  * I can watch the movie on any device, without any differences in how the movie is presented.
  * Movies are not bound to the service provider, and must be DRM-free in the case of purchases.
  * I can easily understand my rights regarding movies that I rent, buy, or stream at a flat rate.
