Yo creo que no pero aquí un ejemplo ilustrativo y «objetivo» 

> Imagine if the Perl cafe and Javahut were across the street from each other. You walk into Javahut, and ask to sit down. «I′m sorry,» says the person at the door. I′m not actually the hostess, I′m a Factory class that can give you a hostess if you tell me what type of seat you want.» You say you want a non-smoking seat, and the person calls over a NonSmokingSeatHostess. The hostess takes you to your seat, and asks if you′ll want breakfast, lunch, or dinner. You say lunch, and she beckons a LunchWaitress. The LunchWaitress takes your order, brings over your food, but there′s no plates to put it on because you forgot to get a CutleryFactory and invoke getPlates, so the Waitress throws a null pointer exception and you get thrown out of the place.

> Dusting yourself off, you walk across the street to the Perl cafe. The person at the door asks what kind of seat you want, what you want to eat, and how you want to pay. They sit you at your seat, bring over your food, collect the money, and leave you to eat in peace. Sure, it′s not the most elegant dining experience you ever had, but you got your food with a minimum of pain.
