Is not the words I want to hear from you<br />
It′s not that I want you<br />
Not to say, but, if you only knew<br />
How easy, it would be to show me how you feel<br />
More than words, is all you have to do to make it real<br />
Then you wouldn′t have to say, that you love me<br />
Cos I′d already know<br />
<br />
What would you do, if my heart was torn in two<br />
More than words to show you feel<br />
That your love for me is real<br />
What would you say, if I took those words away<br />
Then you couldn′t make things new<br />
Just by saying I love you<br />
<br />
More than words...<br />
<br />
Now that I′ve tried to, talk to you and make you understand<br />
All you have to do is close your eyes<br />
And just reach out your hands, and touch me<br />
Hold me close don′t ever let me go<br />
More than words, is all I ever needed you to show<br />
Then you wouldn′t have to say, that you love me<br />
Cos I′d already know<br />
<br />
More than words...<br />
<br />
More than words... </noembed></object>
