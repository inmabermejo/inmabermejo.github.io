<br />
My friends are so depressed<br />
I feel the question<br />
Of your loneliness<br />
Confide... `cause Ill be on your side<br />
You know I will, you know I will<br />
<br />
X girlfriend called me up<br />
Alone and desperate<br />
On the prison phone<br />
They want... to give her 7 years<br />
For being sad<br />
<br />
Chorus :<br />
I love all of you<br />
Hurt by the cold<br />
So hard and lonely too<br />
When you dont know yourself<br />
<br />
My friends are so distressed<br />
And standing on<br />
The brink of emptiness<br />
No words... I know of to express<br />
This emptiness<br />
<br />
Chorus :<br />
Imagine me taught by tragedy<br />
Release is peace<br />
I heard a little girl<br />
And what she said<br />
Was something beautiful<br />
To give... your love<br />
No matter what<br /></noembed>
